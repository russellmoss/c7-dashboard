const SALES_TECHNIQUES_TEXT = `TECHNIQUES TO SUGGEST IF BELOW GOAL (use as inspiration/guardrails, do not copy verbatim):
- For low bottle sales:
  1. Ask how they are enjoying the wine. If they like it, say: "Oh, great. I'll take note so we don't forget in case you want to take some home today."
  2. Remind guests that a tasting fee is waived for every 3 bottles purchased.
  3. Always ask for the sale, even with food/glass guests: "How was the chardonnay? Can I send you home with some?"
  4. Always try to sell bottles, no matter the experience. If a guest is having food and a bottle or glass, ask how the wine was and if you can send them home with wine.
  5. Use analogies to make wine concepts accessible: "Think of oak like a spice rack for wine" or "Acidity is like the zing in lemonade."
  6. Share compelling stories about specific wines - the vineyard, winemaking process, or family history to create emotional connections.
  7. Translate features into benefits: "This wine was hand-harvested (feature), which means only the best grapes were selected, giving you purer fruit flavors (benefit)."
  8. During mid-experience check-in, when a guest loves a wine, say: "That's a favorite here. I'll make a note that you liked it in case you want to revisit that thought later."
  9. Use assumptive closing: "Which of your favorites can I wrap up for you to take home?" instead of "Do you want to buy wine?"
  10. Mention helpful reminders: "You're buying 5 bottles - if you add one more, you get our half-case 5% discount" or "We're almost sold out of that vintage you loved."
  11. Suggest a farewell glass: "While we get your wines ready, would you like a final glass of your favorite to sip?"
  12. Strategic flight suggestions: Encourage flights over single glasses - guests who try multiple wines are more likely to find several they love and purchase.

- For low club sales:
  1. Prime for the club: "Oh, I love that you're doing a flight. A lot of the wines in this flight are favorites of our club members."
  2. Promote the social aspect: "Oh, you're local? I think you'd make a great addition to the club. It's mostly locals and we get together at least once a quarter to have parties."
  3. Accentuate the value: "You get discounts on wine and free tastings throughout the year and if you join today, all of your flights are waived."
  4. Make the big ask first: Always prime and ask for the club sale first. If they don't want it, ask for the bottle sale after.
  5. If someone buys more than 3 bottles: "Oh, you know if you join the club you'll get 10-15% off those bottles today and you'll get your flight fees waived. You just need to take home 4, 6 or 12 bottles today depending upon what tier is best for you."
  6. Plant seeds when taking the order: "As you're deciding on your tasting, I just wanted to mention our Wine Club. Members receive complimentary tastings and discounts on all purchases, including today."
  7. Personalize based on guest profile: For value seekers emphasize savings; for enthusiasts highlight exclusive wines; for locals mention pickup parties and events.
  8. Use the club brochure visually: "Let me show you our three tiers - Jumper, Grand Prix, and Triple Crown - so you can see which fits your wine enjoyment best."
  9. Connect their favorite wines to club benefits: "Since you loved the Reserve Cabernet Franc, our Grand Prix club would be perfect - you'd get it in your shipments plus 15% off starting today."
  10. Highlight immediate gratification: "If you join today, your discount applies to these bottles right now, and you can even take your first club shipment home with you."
  11. For Triple Crown tier: Mention exclusive perks like accommodation discounts, seasonal plate discounts, and reciprocal benefits at other Hudson Valley vineyards.
  12. Address hesitation proactively: "We ask for just 4 shipments minimum. Many members stay for years because of the value and exclusive wines."

- General rapport and sales techniques:
  1. Use open-ended questions: "What brings you to wine country today?" to understand their needs and tailor your approach.
  2. Practice positive profiling: Observe cues (are they taking photos? asking about scores? comparing prices?) to identify their guest type and adapt.
  3. Listen for buying signals: "This is delicious!" or "How much is this one?" are invitations to discuss purchase.
  4. Create surprise moments: Offer a complimentary taste of something special for celebrations or enthusiastic guests.
  5. Place your review card early: Put it on the table when introducing yourself to encourage positive feedback.
  6. Capture data naturally: "Can I email you your receipt? We'll also let you know about upcoming releases of the wines you enjoyed today."
